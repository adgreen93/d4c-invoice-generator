# d4c-invoice_generator
An easy way to create and save invoices online, made for the freelancer in all of us doing dirty deeds done dirt cheap.

After extensively using a free invoice generator while I started up my consulting company, I fell in love with how useful it was - being able to 
generate invoices into PDFs, and things line by line, and have it look professional and clean. I wanted to try build my own version - and while
it's far from as nice, the learning experience was definetely worth it.

It's made with Express & TinyMCE.
